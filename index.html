    <p>Nuala here. I will be joyously starting in the daytime January 2019 class. I enjoy living in Hawthorne/Division neighborhood with my partner Will, teen daughter Raven, a snake named Willow, and a currently empty fish tank. The plan is to get fish this month and baby chicks next month.</p>

    <p>I have dual Irish/US citizenship so I travel back and forth from Ireland regularly. Truly all travel appeals to me.</p>

    <p>My personal interests are languages, gaming, movies, writing/reading, biking, cafe culture, hacking, and music jamming. Although I am alarmingly bad at disc golf, I still enjoy playing it.</p>

    <p>The reason that I wanted to take the Epicodus class is to beef up my coding skills, so that I can be more efficient at working with companies and non-profits. I used to code a long time ago, and enjoyed it in the fascinating/frustrating/fulfilling way that programing can be. I am amazed that much of the logic follows through and there are great tools like editors and Github. However, the jumping and getting it done eludes me, as I seem to be missing some key elements.</p>

<p>This unique home could be exactly what you have been seeking: Your own retreat with private with lovely views from every room in the house.
This place is a true retreat from hectic city life. Most Irish Rentals are on busy roads or an attached part of a complex. Here, the peace and quiet of bird song, or the wind in the trees, or perhaps a cow in the distance are the only noises that you will hear.
This home is on the land of my ancestors. It is ancient here, surrounded by significant historic sites and dolmens. Marking pedestrian paths criss cross around the property to ancient treasures and gorgeous views.
There has been much inspiration for writers here since Yeats wrote of the Terrible Beauty of Sligo. There is even an old school desk here that the American writer Raymond Carver wrote about as inspiration. Music has been played and Poems have been read here.
Enjoy the solitude in nature on the side of the mountainside. Lovely views of mountains in the distance.
Walk to Lough Arrow or Lough Bo for some fishing. Stop by Cromleach Lodge for a dinner or spa treatment. Hike to the Moytura Battlefield or the Labby Rock to experience some real live legends.
Centrally located between Castlebaldwin, Riverstown, Sligo, Boyle/Carrick, and Ballymote. Travel to different Art and Music festivals through-out the region. Try out surfing on one day and travel to charming shopping the next day.
