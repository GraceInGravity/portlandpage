  <p>Nuala here. I will be joyously starting in the daytime January 2019 class. I enjoy living in Hawthorne/Division neighborhood with my partner Will, teen daughter Raven, a snake named Willow, and a currently empty fish tank. The plan is to get fish this month and baby chicks next month.
  <p>I have dual Irish/US citizenship so I travel back and forth from Ireland regularly. Truly all travel appeals to me.</p>

  <p>My personal interests are languages, gaming, movies, writing/reading, biking, cafe culture, hacking, and music jamming. Although I am alarmingly bad at disc golf, I still enjoy playing it.</p>

  <p>Cheers,Nuala (pronounced NewLa/Not picky about pronouns)</p>
